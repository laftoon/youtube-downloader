# youtube-downloader
My code for a nice yotube downloader. 

This is one of my practice codes for getting used to GUIs and different modules. 

In case you're done with slow online youtube video downloaders you can use my code to make you own program.

You'll need to pipinstall pytube and customtkinter libraries for this to work
